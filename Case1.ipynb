The first column contains the date, then the 3 Fama and French factors (the excess return on the market, `mktrf`, the size factor, `smb`, and the value factor, `hml`), then the momentum factor (`umd`), followed by 4 ETFs: `chep` from Quantshares, `mom` from Quantshares, `vbr` from Vanguard, and `mtum` from iShares. The ETF returns are in excess of 30-day T-bill rate.\n",

    "The goal of the `chep` ETF is to provide exposure to the value factor, while the goal of `mom` is to provide exposure to the momentum factor. `vbr` is a small-cap value ETF, while the goal of `mtum` is to provide exposure to the momentum factor.\n",
